I am a postdoctoral fellow at Insight Centre for Data Analytics at Dublin City University (DCU), Ireland.
Currently, I am working on lifelogging and multimedia verification, which I am organizing the ImageCLEF 2018 – Lifelog, ACM ICMR - Lifelog search challenge, and the NTCIR 14 – Lifelog 3, and Multimedia Verification
task at MediaEval, the pioneer workshops and benchmarking initiatives in these fields.

On this page you can find my [curriculum vitae](/cv/), my [projects](/projects/), [modules](/teaching/), and a list of my [publications](/publications/) – which may all be more or less up-to-date.
